# ASEBCLASS


ASEBCLASS is a Python script that is written for the classification for light curve morphologies of the ASAS-SN eclipsing binary star systems from their light curve images. Mainly, the ASAS-SN project database [1,2] was used, however, the code can be modified for classifying the light curve morphologies of binary stars from any other database having enough number of light curve images.

The image data used in the code can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13upqcE5ODYr0VjBrbqe92-HUeXTZRbTz?usp=sharing
